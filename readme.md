## 1. What do you know about DevOps?

A: As its name suggests, DevOps combines software development and software operations principles with the goal of helping organizations develop products with greater speed and efficiency.

#DevOps is a practice that enables organizations to optimize speed and efficiency across IT functions.
“DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.”
#“DevOps people are basically those who have found interest in both systems administration and software development and decided to combine their skills to create a unified, better approach to both.”

## 2. How is DevOps different from agile methodology?

A: DevOps is a culture that allows the development and the operations team to 
work together. This results in continuous development, testing, integration, 
deployment, and monitoring of the software throughout the lifecycle.
Agile is a software development methodology that focuses on iterative, 
incremental, small, and rapid releases of software, along with customer 
feedback. It addresses gaps and conflicts between the customer and 
developers

## 3. Which are some of the most popular DevOps tools?

A: The most popular DevOps tools include:
1. Selenium
2. Puppet
3. Chef
4. Git
5. Jenkins
6. Ansible
7. Docke

## 4. What are the different phases in DevOps?

A: The various phases of the DevOps lifecycle are as follows:
Plan - Initially, there should be a plan for the type of application that needs to 
be developed. Getting a rough picture of the development process is always a 
good idea.
Code - The application is coded as per the end-user requirements. 
Build - Build the application by integrating various codes formed in the 
previous steps.
Test - This is the most crucial step of the application development. Test the 
application and rebuild, if necessary.
Integrate - Multiple codes from different programmers are integrated into one.
Deploy - Code is deployed into a cloud environment for further usage. It is 
ensured that any new changes do not affect the functioning of a high traffic 
website. 
Operate - Operations are performed on the code if required. 
Monitor - Application performance is monitored. Changes are made to meet 
the end-user requirements

## 5. Mention some of the core benefits of DevOps.

A: The core benefits of DevOps are as follows:
Technical benefits

• Continuous software delivery
• Less complex problems to manage
• Early detection and faster correction of defects

Business benefits

• Faster delivery of features
• Stable operating environments
• Improved communication and collaboration between the team

## 6. Reports

A: Results from the "2017 State of DevOps" Report suggest striking differences between high performance organizations employing DevOps principles and organizations that do not. According to the report, high performance organizations have far higher software deployment frequencies (46 times more frequent), far faster lead time for changes (440 times faster), and a significantly lower software change failure rate (five times lower) than their lower performance counterparts.

## Extra:

As software development and operations become more closely intertwined, and as companies become increasingly reliant on cloud infrastructure, executives and project managers must develop fluency in DevOps to remain competitive and ensure their teams are performing at their full potential.
