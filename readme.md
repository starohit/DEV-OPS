## 2. How is DevOps different from agile methodology?
A: DevOps is a culture that allows the development and the operations team to 
work together. This results in continuous development, testing, integration, 
deployment, and monitoring of the software throughout the lifecycle.
Agile is a software development methodology that focuses on iterative, 
incremental, small, and rapid releases of software, along with customer 
feedback. It addresses gaps and conflicts between the customer and 
developers
